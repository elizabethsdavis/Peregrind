Right now I've got the images loading from the ParseTutorial app on Parse

TODOs
- get images + comments uploaded to backend
- once have username + facebook photos, upload those and pull for kik wall


- log in storyboard
- log in by Facebook (can use Parse for this)


nice to haves:
- profile page
- like/comments
- creation of "projects"
