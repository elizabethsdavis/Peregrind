Right now I've got the images loading from the ParseTutorial app on Parse

broad TODOs
- get images + comments uploaded to backend
- once have username + facebook photos, upload those and pull for kik wall



- log in storyboard
- log in by Facebook (can use Parse for this)


- support videos in addition to images (worse comes to worst we just don't do this)

small fixes TODOs:
- fix cancel button in upload image flow
- make sure that long descriptions don't overflow outside of the box
- make the image displayed on the captioning page in the upload flow not weird dimensions (storyboard issue)
- only allow the app to work in portrait (or fix views to work in landscape)

nice to haves:
- profile page
- like/comments

- creation of "projects"
